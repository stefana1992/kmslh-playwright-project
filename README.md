# Explained in a few sentences which part of the system I would automate and why:

**I would automate the user interaction module, including navigation, dynamic UI components, and essential submission forms like "Book a Demo" and "Apply for this job."
The "Book a Demo" form is crucial as it captures potential customer interest, directly impacting business growth.
Similarly, the "Apply for this job" form plays a key role in managing candidate applications and supporting recruitment.
Automating these workflows helps ensure system reliability and stability, reducing errors and minimizing the risk of losing potential customers or candidates due to form or navigation issues.**
